# ap-stats-final-project
This is my semester 2 final project for AP Statistics (2020-2021)
The goal of my project was to determine what proportion of dice sold by a company were 'fair'
In order to decide which dice were 'fair', I used a chi-square goodness of fit test

I wrote this code in order to aid my data collection and calculation, as my sample included 100 dice and I had no desire to manually input all of the data points into a spreadsheet and do the calculations individually.

There are additional steps to my project not included in this depository because I used my ti-84 graphing cacluator for some of the analysis, and various other online websites and calculators such as Desmos to gain a better understanding of the distribution of my data
